the file bpi-50x50-fancover--1.6--.stl creates a place for a fan mount while separating the Pi and heat from the screen that mounts into the 4 corner posts. 

the file bpim3-12npb.stl builds the mounting base for the banana pi m3 with a screen on top.
 
the screen that fits the screw holes in the mount is:

That screen is not very functional being only 5" but I use it mostly to make sure the pi is running. Using anydesk (tm) or nomachine (tm) to access the pi desktop is how I access the pi. 

If you bought an m3, like I did, then so sorry there's not much support for it. The 10 cores that the m3 have don't seem to be much more beneficial than the 4 cores the Orange Pi Prime uses (my prefered board). The Orange series of Pi's are well supported and developed.
