The mount for the Orange Pi Prime includes 4 posts for installing a 5" tft touch screen. The one used is

The fan lid print is designed to keep heat away from the screen and keep it from recirculating into the fan. The fan mount in the banana pi folder is a better fan mount/ board shield so I recommend using that one. 

It's not large enough to be useful but I use it just to be able to visually verify what is running on the OrPiPrime. I use anydesk (tm) or nomachine(tm) to remote desktop to the OrPiPrime to program and test.

No guarantee, warranty, or suitability for any purpose is conveyed with these designs. They were printed using an Ender5 Plus.

Use as you will.
